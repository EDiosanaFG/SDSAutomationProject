- Wants SDS to be automated
- Maybe dropdown menus with options
- The most we get SDSs from are from Ningbo
- We also get SDSs from Millipore Sigma
- There are too many different templates

- SDSs are standardized but some of the information we don't want
    - We should be sourcing where we get the chemicals from, but it should just be a footnote
    - Contact numbers should be Inovo contact numbers

- Dropdowns:
    - For example, Recommended storage temperature:
        1. Ambient temperature
        2. Refrigerated
        3. etc.....

- If we can pull the information from the fields and put them into the excel spreadsheets, that would be great
- If we have any chemical raw materials, Sigma usually has it
    - If it is a herb, we have to rely on the supplier to do that

- We will rely on Ningbo and Sigma SDSs for now

# Basically:
- We want everything from the SDS to be placed into the inovo SDS template

# Find IB MSDS
- Under bon-fs -> IBLabs -> Regulatory

- Can we inject data into MS Access? We have to first enter the data into MS Access, which then prints out the Safety Data Sheet


# Excel Injection Idea
- Gordon suggested using Excel as an intermediate step
- How about we inject the info from the sheets (.docx, .pdf) into an Excel file and then have them just copy-paste it
